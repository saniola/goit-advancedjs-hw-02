# Advanced JavaScript Homework 02

## Overview
This repository contains three tasks as part of the Advanced JavaScript course at GoIT Neoversity. Each task demonstrates different aspects of working with JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous operations, and using third-party libraries.

### Task 1: Color Switcher
Create a color switcher that changes the background color of the page every second when the "Start" button is pressed, and stops changing the color when the "Stop" button is pressed. The "Start" button should be disabled while the color switching is active.

### Task 2: Countdown Timer
Create a countdown timer that counts down to a selected date and time. The user can select the date and time using a date picker. If the selected date is in the past, an error message is shown. The timer updates every second, and the user can select a new date at any time, which resets the timer.

### Task 3: Promise Generator
Create a promise generator that generates a specified number of promises. Each promise resolves or rejects after a specified delay. The delays increase incrementally for each subsequent promise. The results of the promises (fulfilled or rejected) are displayed using notifications.
